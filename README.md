# How to work with the code

In app_src there is an XCode project that you can open and use to build, run and package the binary as a Mac .app file.
Resources are all located in the resources folder (.wav, fonts, .pngs etc.)

The project should work out of the box:
    $ git clone https://github.com/divyekapoor/hotkeyz
    $ cd hotkeyz/app_src
    $ open
